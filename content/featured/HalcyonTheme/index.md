Blindly reproduced a Maximum Entropy Deep Learning model for Human Social Navigation in TensorFlow with trajectories accurate within 0.5 meters, and connducted five in-depth ablation studies to understand the impact of various model components like learning rate, state dimensions, and network layers. Received second place at the ML@Purdue X DagsHub ML Hackathon.
