Predicted energy usage for hydraulic fracturing efforts from ExxonMobil data alongside PhD students by preprocessing, addressing missing values through kNN imputation, and validating results. Then, we applied Random Forest and XGBoost to achieve highest validation while leveraging unsupervised KMeans clustering to enhance prediction accuracy. Quantified uncertainty via boostrapping and Gaussian noise.
